## Composition layer

## Inventory and documentation rollout

- `PROTOKIT-INVENTORY.md` — current inventory and documentation status.
- `DOCUMENTATION-BACKLOG.md` — prioritized documentation work.
- `HOW-TO-DOCUMENT-A-PROTOKIT.md` — step-by-step documentation workflow.
- `DOCS-PUSH-CHECKLIST.md` — checklist for documentation pushes.

## Families

- `families/COMPOSITION-FAMILY.md`

## Templates

- `templates/DSM-SPEC.md` — spec template for new or materially changed kits.
- `templates/DSM-IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md` — implementation checklist.
- `templates/DSM-REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md` — review checklist.
- `templates/PROTOKIT-README.md` — README template for kit documentation.
- `templates/DOMAIN-BOUNDARY.md` — domain-boundary documentation template.

- `templates/DEPLOY-KIT-MANIFEST.md` — deploy manifest template.
- `templates/DOMAIN-BOUNDARY-REVIEW.md` — boundary review checklist.

## Examples

- `examples/HOUSE-DOMAIN-BOUNDARIES.md` — demonstrates house as reusable domain boundaries instead of a one-off game object.
- `Raw_conversation_explanation.md` — raw explanation of the earlier DSK / ProtoKit architecture conversation and decisions.

## Core naming rule

```txt
DSM = architecture concept
Kit = implementation unit
```

In this repo, DSMs are built and shipped as `-kit` folders with `createXKit()` factories.

## Core principle

A kit defines a domain and exposes services/API that make that domain happen. Larger kits compose smaller kits recursively until the remaining parts are atomic.

Games should compose kits through data. Games should not define reusable architecture directly.

## Composition-first extension

For object proofs and idea-packet-driven work, prefer upgrading existing bounded containers before creating new kits.

Object-specific packets such as banana, coin, button, crate, and potion are specs/presets/proofs, not standalone kits.

## Rule of thumb

```txt
Reusable behavior -> domain kit
Reusable composition behavior -> lifecycle/session/deploy kit
Specific game setup -> deploy manifest or preset data
Specific object placement -> scene data
Heavy media -> asset pack
Authored flow -> sequence
Presentation -> renderer adapter or host
```
